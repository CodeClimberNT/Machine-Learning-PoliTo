# Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition
This is my personal space to save and backup my solution for the laboratory of machine learning and pattern recognition 
during my attendance at "Politecnico di Torino" in the academic year `2023-2024`

# Usage
Using conda import the required package from `environment.yaml` to run all the code (does not include notebook package)

# Note
Since I later discovered the course will be use `.py` file instead of notebook for evaluation I transitioned to them and didn't correct
for refactor of code or similar. 
The main code should work but the referenced file may be wrong, use at your own risk.
